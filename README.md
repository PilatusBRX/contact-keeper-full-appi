# Contact Keeper API

This is a Node/Express/MongoDB REST API for contacts that uses JWT authentication. All contact endpoints are protected and each registered user has their own contacts. This is used in my React course on Udemy. It is the API ONLY. The fullstack app can be found [here](https://github.com/bradtraversy/contact-keeper)

## Getting Started

```
  Open the config/default.json file and add your mongoURI and your jwtSecret
```

```bash
  npm install
  npm run server # Runs on http://localhost:5000
```
